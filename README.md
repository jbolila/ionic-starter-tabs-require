# Ionic tabs project with require.js

[Getting Started with Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/), one nice way to generate beautiful mobile App's with Cordova (aka PhoneGap) and AngularJS.

Please add the plugins:

```
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.console
cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.device
```

After that just:

```
ionic platform add ios
ionic build ios
ionic emulate ios
```

.. clone, copy, improve and don't give reference, be happy!
